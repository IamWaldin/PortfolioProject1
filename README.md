SQL, Tableau
Data Exploration
Setting up Data for Visualization in Tablaeu
Performing Joins between two Tables
Create a new table with SQL Code
Create Views to store Data for later Visualizations
The whole purpose of this Data Exploration Project is not to keep the Project too simple but to showcase that i can perform advance tasks in SQL.
I will perform 15 queries, I will not be using all of them for Visualization in my Tablaeu Project but I want to Demonstrate my Understanding of SQL as well as my Ability to Create and run Different Queries. 
I will add additional comments in the code just to assist and bring more understanding to the queries as I progress
MY FINAL 5 QUERIES I SELCT FOR MY TABLAEU VISUALIZATIONS PROJECT IS IN THE OTHER FILE TITLED "TABLAEU VISUALIZATION QUERIES"
